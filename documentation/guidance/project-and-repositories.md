# Project and Repositories

Every source code repository should include documentation that is specific to it (e.g., in a Wiki within the repository), while the project itself should include general documentation that is common to all its associated repositories (e.g., in a Wiki within the backlog management tool).

## Documentation specific to a repository

- Introduction.
- Getting started.
  - Onboarding.
  - Setup: programming language, frameworks, platforms, tools, etc.
  - Sandbox environment.
  - Working Agreement.
  - Contributing Guide.
- Structure: folders, projects, etc.
- How to compile, test, build, deploy the solution/each project.
  - Different OS versions.
  - Command line + editors/IDEs.
- Design decision records.

Some sections in the documentation of the repository might point to the projectâ€™s documentation (e.g., Onboarding, Working Agreement, Contributing Guide).
